# This lets see if my replication is like the findings in the article testing if On average, 33.6% of the housing in tracts is either occupied by a renter or vacant for rent, out of a total 140.9 million housing units in 2022. In 29,251 tracts, less than 20% of the housing stock is either renter- occupied or vacant for rent. These rental deserts account for 35.1% of the more than 84,000 tracts nationally but cover about two thirds of the countryâ€™s land area. In 11,313 tracts (13.6%), are what we consider extreme rental deserts in which less than 10% of the stock is occupied by renters or vacant for rent.

# My results are slightly different as I got 31.7 percent instead of 33.6. 
# I got 142506742 and the article had 140.9 million housing units in 2022 
# I got 31,520 for the number of rental deserts, 85,396 total national tracts, and 36.9% of rental deserts 
# I got 12,472 for extreme rental deserts and then 14.6 for the percentage of extreme rental deserts.
